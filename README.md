# OSH Setup Tool

OSH Setup Tool or OST is a minimal CLI tool to setup a new OSH project.
It currently will fetch the recommended directories of the specified OSH project and clone them from Github.

It is required that you have git installed on your system.

Further improvements are planned as time allows.
